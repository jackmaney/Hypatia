**Note:** The files for the distribution itself (ie what you'd get from [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/Hypatia)) are available in the folder `Hypatia-$version` (where `$version` represents the version number).

For the most up-to-date information, look at [the documentation](https://metacpan.org/module/Hypatia).
